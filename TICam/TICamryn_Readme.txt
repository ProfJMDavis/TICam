The goal: Camryn is intended as a primarily teen "quest" that introduces a new NPC and extends one game NPC for BG1:RE. The PC is told the story of the love-affair and eventual breakup of Camryn, the Master Illuminator and Scribe for Candlekeep, and his headstrong lover, Tamah. Should the PC be willing, s/he can collect up to thirteen letters written by Camryn and expressing his feelings on different aspects of his love for Tamah. These letters, if taken to Tamah, will influence the outcome of the two's long-standing love-affair.   
The reality: Camryn is a working alpha in a somewhat bare-bones state. Additional options need to be scripted, both allowing the PC more flexibility in answering comments by the NPC's, and also allowing for greater variation in the final encounter.

Notes: Camryn and Tamah's dialogues are already comfortably teen-rated. I *think* I may need to provide optional teen-rated versions of two of the letters which have some suggestive, but not explicit, erotic content. Any and all comments and suggestions are welcome!

Camryn's soundset ("taldarkg") was found online (http://www.chaosbutterfly.net/bg2/). I hope to custom record another one. Tamah's soundset is custom recorded. Camryn's absolutely beautiful portrait is GenMELF (from the alternate portrait mod by artastrophe and Lava Del'Vortel).
